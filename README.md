Analyses for 2025 Klag Lake Sockeye Salmon monitoring project. These scripts can be generalized for most salmon weir projects.

Your data will need to be in the same "data" folder with the same file names and structure.
You will need folders titled appendices, code, data, inputs, outputs, plots, and results. Intermediate files will be automatically generated by R scripts.

Contact Kyle Rosendale at kyle.rosendale@sitkatribe-nsn.gov with questions.

R scripts follow a general pattern:
1. Title, contact, date
2. List of R scripts that must be run first
3. List of output files and locations
4. Load libraries
5. Locate directory with here package and load data
6. Manipulate data
7. Generate plots and save as .png files in plots folder
8. Save results to .csv files in results folder
9. Generate appendices in .png format in appendices folder
